WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications

Description 
This week's Challenge requires you to create an application that an employee can use to see previous projects done by the developer. This app will run in the browser, and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code. It will have a clean and polished user interface that is responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.

then the viewer is presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them. When you click one of the links in the navigation then the UI scrolls to the corresponding section. When you click on the link to the section about their work then the UI links to a section with titled images of the developer's applications. Then you are presented with the developer's first application.Then once hovering over that application the image should be larger in size than the others. When you click on the images of the applications then you are taken to that deployed application.
